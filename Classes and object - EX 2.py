# Classes and Objects - Exercise 2 üêç

"""
Now continue with the Animal class we had used before 

Add a method to count the legs `count_legs`
which prints the number of legs 

Add a method to count the legs `return_legs`
which returns the number of legs 

print number of legs directly from  `number_of_legs` 
variable of the object
