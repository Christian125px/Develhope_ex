    "In the Gregorian calendar, a normal year consists of 365 days. Since the actual length of a sidereal year (the time it takes for the Earth to revolve once around the Sun) is actually 365.2425 days, a \"leap year\" of 366 days is used once every four years to eliminate the error caused by three normal (but shorter) years. Any year that is evenly divisible by 4 is a leap year: for example, 1988, 1992, and 1996 are leap years.\n",
