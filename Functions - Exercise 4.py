# Version 1: two parameters, default values, for loop, list, string operation

# function definition
def greet ( name = 'John', surname = 'Doe' ): # assigning default values to name, surname parameters as requested

    print(f"Hello {name} {surname}!")

# creating a list containing the names of all the family members
family = [ "John Doe", "Tristram Mcbride", "Baldwin Preston", "Wally Collins" ]

# looping through all the names available in the list family
for member in family:
    name, surname = member.split() # using split method and saving name and surname of each family member into two variables ( name, surname )
    greet ( name, surname ) # call to the function for each for loop iteration


# Version 2: one parameter, for loop, list, string operation, list index

# def greet ( family ) :
#     for i in range(len(family)):
#         if i == 0:
#             print( "Hello John Doe!" )
#         else:
#             name, surname = family[i].split()
#             print( f"Hello {name} {surname}!" )

# family_list = [ "John Doe", "Tristram Mcbride", "Baldwin Preston", "Wally Collins" ]
# greet ( family_list )
